# Django-LMS-HandsOn
Building a simple LMS with Django featuring user auth, course management, and discussions. Project still in progress.

Iâ€™m building a simple Learning Management System (LMS) using Django, designed for students and instructors to create and engage with courses, discussions, and learning materials. It features user authentication, course management, and interactive rooms for communication. The project is still in progress, showcasing my skills in Python, Django ORM, and CRUD operations, as well as my understanding of backend logic and web app development
